By optimizing ion diffusion dynamics through rational design of electrode nanostructures, we can enhance charge/discharge rates, increase energy density, and extend the lifespan of energy storage devices. The key prediction is that electrodes with hierarchical nanostructures, comprising of interconnected networks of nanoparticles, nanowires, or nanosheets, will exhibit improved electrochemical performance compared to their bulk or microstructured counterparts.",

First, we will synthesize and characterize a series of nanostructured electrode materials with varying geometries using techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Next, we will assemble these materials into energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries or supercapacitors, and evaluate their electrochemical performance using techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We will also investigate the ion diffusion dynamics within these nanostructured electrodes using techniques like in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
