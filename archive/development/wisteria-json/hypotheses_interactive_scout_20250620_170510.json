Methylation of mtDNA can influence gene expression, affecting mitochondrial function and dynamics. We predict that changes in mtDNA methylation levels, particularly at specific CpG sites, disrupt mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration, and mitophagy, ultimately leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. Key predictions include: (1) mtDNA methylation patterns are altered in neurodegenerative disease models and patient samples; (2) these changes correlate with disease progression and severity; and (3) manipulating mtDNA methylation levels can modulate disease phenotypes in cellular and animal models.",

We will use techniques such as bisulfite sequencing, pyrosequencing, and methylation-specific PCR to assess mtDNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites. Next, we will employ CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and/or pharmacological interventions to modulate mtDNA methylation levels in neurons and assess the impact on mitochondrial function, cellular viability, and disease-relevant phenotypes.

      "title": "The Role of Ferroptosis in Neurodegenerative Diseases",
      "description": "This hypothesis proposes that ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Ferroptosis could contribute to neuronal loss and disease progression by promoting lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Key predictions include the identification of specific markers of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases and the demonstration that inhibiting ferroptosis can protect against neuronal loss.",
      "experimental_validation": "To validate this hypothesis, we will first conduct a comprehensive analysis of ferroptosis markers (e.g., lipid peroxides, iron levels) in post-mortem brain tissues from patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Next, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to assess the impact of ferroptosis inhibition on neuronal survival and disease progression. Expected outcomes include evidence that ferroptosis contributes to neurodegenerative diseases and that targeting ferroptosis can provide therapeutic benefits.",
