While amyloid-beta remains a central focus, targeting the lysosomal pathway may offer a broader and possibly more effective therapeutic strategy. By enhancing lysosomal function, it may be possible to improve the degradation and clearance of multiple toxic species, addressing a significant gap in amyloid-centric approaches."

This approach is scientifically plausible and aligns with emerging evidence, representing a significant departure from traditional therapeutic targets.",
        "explanation": "The hypothesis is based on challenging the assumption that amyloid-beta is the primary therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Current therapies focusing on amyloid-beta have not been successful in reversing or significantly delaying disease progression. One key assumption is that amyloid-beta accumulation is the earliest and primary driver of synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. However, growing evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction can occur independently and may even precede amyloid-beta plaque formation. By targeting synaptic vesicle dynamics, we are addressing a potentially earlier and causative aspect of the disease, which may lead to more effective therapeutic interventions."

However, clinical outcomes of amyloid-targeting drugs have been disappointing, suggesting that other pathways might be involved. One key assumption is that amyloid-beta is the central pathogenic feature, supported by its presence in plaques; however, the correlation between amyloid burden and cognitive decline is weak. Another assumption is that amyloid-beta accumulation is an early event leading to downstream effects, yet some individuals with high amyloid burden do not exhibit symptoms. Challenging these assumptions, our hypothesis posits that energy metabolism dysregulation, particularly involving mitochondria and glucose metabolism, plays a central role in disease pathology. This reframing aligns with growing evidence of metabolic deficits in Alzheimer's and offers a new therapeutic target that could lead to more effective treatments."
