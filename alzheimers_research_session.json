One key assumption is that amyloid-beta is the central pathogenic feature, supported by its presence in plaques; however, the correlation between amyloid burden and cognitive decline is weak. Another assumption is that amyloid-beta accumulation is an early event leading to downstream effects, yet some individuals with high amyloid burden do not exhibit symptoms. Challenging these assumptions, our hypothesis posits that energy metabolism dysregulation, particularly involving mitochondria and glucose metabolism, plays a central role in disease pathology.

While amyloid-beta accumulation has long been considered a primary driver of AD, therapies targeting this pathway have largely failed to produce significant clinical benefits. Recent literature highlights the role of mitochondrial dynamics in maintaining neuronal health, suggesting that dysregulation of these processes can exacerbate AD pathology.
